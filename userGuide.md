## Using Your Website

### Dashboard - Market Overview

When you log in, you arrive at the **Dashboard** which displays the current cryptocurrency market overview. The dashboard shows real-time prices for major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano. Each card displays the current price in USD, 24-hour price change percentage, and 7-day performance metrics.

### AI Predictions Panel

Below the market overview, the **AI Predictions** section displays machine learning-generated price forecasts. Each prediction shows the predicted price direction (Bullish, Bearish, or Stable), the accuracy percentage, and a confidence score displayed as a progress bar. This helps you understand the AI's confidence level in each prediction.

### Market Sentiment Analysis

The **Market Sentiment Analysis** section provides insights into overall market psychology. Each cryptocurrency displays a sentiment score (0-100), with higher scores indicating more bullish sentiment. The analysis breaks down sentiment into three categories: Bullish (green), Bearish (red), and Neutral (gray), each shown as a percentage with visual progress bars.

### Managing Your Watchlist

Click "View Watchlist" on the dashboard to access your personal watchlist. Here you can add cryptocurrencies by entering their symbol (e.g., BTC, ETH) or using the quick-add buttons for popular coins. Your watchlist displays current prices and 24-hour/7-day changes for each cryptocurrency. Remove items by clicking the trash icon next to any entry.

### Setting Up Trading Alerts

Click "Manage Alerts" to create custom trading alerts. You can set alerts for three types of events: "Price Above" (notify when price exceeds a target), "Price Below" (notify when price drops below a target), or "Sentiment Change" (notify when market sentiment shifts). Each alert can be toggled active/inactive or deleted at any time.
